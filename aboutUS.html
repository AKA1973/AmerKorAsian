        <h2><e>COMPANY GOALS:</e></h2>
        <P><u>AmerKorAsian invests based on a long-term horizon and focuses on the company’s fundamentals. No investment advice is neither given or asked for by AmerKorAsian. All investment decisions are made solely by AmerKorAsian without regard to outside factors. If you decide to invest with AmerKorAsian, you agree and understand that no investment advice was offered to you by AmerKorAsian about what pie or other investments AmerKorAsian offers.</u></P>

        <h2><e>FOUNDER'S MESSAGE</e></h2>
        <P><u>The reason why Ryan Holland decided to create AmerKorAsian is because he wanted to be able to help people be successful with investing. How does AmerKorAsian do this you ask? This is the best part, AmerKorAsian will do all the work making sure everyone’s investments are well managed. AmerKorAsian will monitor the markets and take the necessary actions to achieve consistent returns on all funds offered for investment.</u></P>
        <br>
        <P><u>People believe that a good annual return on investment is between 6%-8%. Since 2004, AmerKorAsian has had an annualized return 5.5%-10% higher than this benchmark, which includes the years that the markets were down because of the Global Housing Market Crash that began in 2007. Like Warren Buffett, AmerKorAsian believes that if you select good stocks, you don’t need to change positions frequently. A perfect example of holding the same positions for the long term can be seen in the Vanguard Pie. This pie has only changed positions a couple times since its inception in 2004.</u></P>
        <br>
        <P><u>AmerKorAsian can’t promise a gain every year, but AmerKorAsian can promise that over the long-term, the pies will provide a good annualized return. These results can be seen by looking at the monthly returns all the pies have achieved since being created at the beginning of 2019. AmerKorAsian did create 2 new pies, the AKA Fund, because of COVID-19, that was available to investors in April, 2020; and the Popular Stocks Fund, that was available for investing April 2021.</u></P>
        <br>
        <p><u>All pies offered by AmerKorAsian consistently go through many different scenarios to make sure the risk/reward meets the guidelines set forth by AmerKorAsian to preserve capital by limiting losses.</u></p>
