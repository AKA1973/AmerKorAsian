              COVID-19 was the reason I started this pie. People needing to invest
              for retirement and think about the future doesn't stop because the
              world is hit with a pandemic. So this pie will adjust based on major
              economic events that effect us globally.

          * This Pie was not available for investing until May 2021. But I
          wanted to be fully transparent in the actual results of this pie
          This fund holds stocks that are popular with investors. Because
          investor sentiment changes quickly, this pie will be more actively
          managed than the other pies and positions will change more
          frequently. For this reason, this pie will require an initial
          investment of $100 and is only suitable for people with a high
          tolerance for risk as this pie will change in larger amounts more
          often than the other pies available
        </w></p>
        <br>
        <p><w>
          This pie is not suitable for all investors and only should be
          considered for individuals who are interested in more risky
          investments.
          </w></p>
        <br>
        <p><w>
          * The current rules for this pie will be updated as needed to make
          sure wise-investment choices are being made.
